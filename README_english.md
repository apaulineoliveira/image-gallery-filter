<h1 align="center">Goal</h1>

     <p>The goal of this project was to create an e-commerce gallery filter where each section contains products from its respective industry. The tools used were: html5, css3, and javascript (pure). As far as the javascript solution is concerned, I mainly used the DOM (Document Object Model) to perform interactions with html and css, mainly using <code>querySelector()</code>. Manipulating <code>querySelector()</code> it was possible to "take" the css style selectors and assign them to interactivity commands with javascript. As can be seen in the code below:</p>

````filterContainer.querySelector(".active").classList.remove("active");````

<br>

<p>In addition, the <code>forEach()</code> method was used to traverse the array and pass a <b>callback</b> function for each element of the array, along with the current value (item ), and then a conditional <code>if/else</code> structure is passed.</p> <br>
